**Overview**
This project analyzes a music store dataset obtained from Kaggle, comprising multiple files, including customer, invoice, invoice_line, employee, genre, artist, track, album, and playlist.


**Dataset Schema**
We've structured the dataset with a clear schema connecting tables, allowing for easy data retrieval and analysis.


**Key Concepts Explored**
This project revisits essential SQL concepts and introduces new ones, including:

Basic SQL Operations: Data selection, filtering, and aggregation.
Common Table Expressions (CTE): Creating temporary result sets for complex queries.
Variables: Using user-defined variables for data manipulation.
Partitioning: Optimizing table performance through data segmentation.


**Problem Solving**
We address questions of varying complexity:

Easy: Calculate averages, select data, and use variables.
Moderate: Group and summarize data, apply window functions, and perform table joins.
Advanced: Employ CTEs for complex queries and explore partitioning for large datasets.
